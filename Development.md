## Building
To get started, here are all the tools you need:
* IntelliJ
* pythonyaml.jar
* Github Desktop
* The EBProjEdit Repository

Clone the EBProjEdit Repository in Github Desktop, then open the project folder in IntelliJ. 
Go to File > Project Structure and under Project Settings, click Libraries, click the "+" icon, click Java, then click on the "pythonyaml.jar". 
Go to Artifacts under Project Settings, click the "+" icon, click Jar "From modules and dependencies". 
Click on the folder in Main Class and click "Ebhack (ebhack)", click OK and OK again.

Go to Build > Build Artifacts > Build
Wait for it to finish building. Once it's done, look for "EbHack.java" in the src folder, right click and Run "EbHack.main()".

Congrats.
